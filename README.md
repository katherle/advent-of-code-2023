This repository contains Fortran code written for practice while learning the language. The repository is called Advent of Code because that's what I started out using, but I eventually moved on to other exercises that had more direct scientific applications.

`advent_of_code` folder: Code I wrote using exercises from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023. Each day's exercise is a separate file, using non-public input text files. 

`byo_gibbs_sampler` folder: After moving on from the Advent of Code exercises, I decided to try reproducing a python notebook from the 2021 AST5240 course at the University of Oslo in which the objective was to build a gibbs sampler. This folder contains a Fortran version of that exercise.
